    ### DELIVERABLE:
    Create 3 content examples (one per channel) that align with the strategy:
    1. EMAIL: Subject line + first paragraph (compelling opener)
    2. SOCIAL MEDIA: 1-2 posts with hashtags (platform-appropriate)
    3. LANDING PAGE: Headline + key benefits section

    Each example should:
    - Include a clear value proposition
    - Have a compelling call-to-action
    - Provide visual direction suggestions
    - Match the brand voice and campaign goals
